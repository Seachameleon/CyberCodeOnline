Loose biohazards and bionics. All of it's usable, luckily enough. It's going to take some work sorting empty Pain Away bottles from unspent auto-inject hypodermics, and a lot of sanitizing, but in your hands it's worth its weight in gold.

Supply shortages have made good medical care hard to come by, and even harder to get in line for. Most stuff you or I buy off the shelf is just recycled from spent junk like this anyways; anything can look new and shiny with enough polish. There's word among junkies on the street that if you die after hitting up something valuable they recycle that too, suck it right out of your blood before you're put to rest. The junk in your hands could have been re-used a dozen times and you wouldn't even know it. It's safe to use though. Just, y'know. Wash it well.
